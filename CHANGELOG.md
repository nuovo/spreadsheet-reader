### v.0.5.3  2013-08-12

- Fix for repeated columns in ODS files not reading correctly (thanks to [etfb](https://github.com/etfb))
- Fix for filename extension reading (Thanks to [osuwariboy](https://github.com/osuwariboy))

### v.0.5.2  2013-06-28

- A fix for the case when row count wasn't read correctly from the sheet in a XLS file.

### v.0.5.1  2013-06-27

- Fixed file type choice when using mime-types (previously there were problems with  
XLSX and ODS mime-types) (Thanks to [incratec](https://github.com/incratec))

- Fixed an error in XLSX iterator where `current()` would advance the iterator forward  
with each call. (Thanks to [osuwariboy](https://github.com/osuwariboy))

### v.0.5.0  2013-06-17

- Multiple sheet reading is now supported:
	- The `Sheets()` method lets you retrieve a list of all sheets present in the file.
	- `ChangeSheet($Index)` method changes the sheet in the reader to the one specified.

- Previously temporary files that were extracted, were deleted after the SpreadsheetReader  
was destroyed but the empty directories remained. Now those are cleaned up as well.  

### v.0.4.3  2013-06-14

- Bugfix for shared string caching in XLSX files. When the shared string count was larger  
than the caching limit, instead of them being read from file, empty strings were returned.  

### v.0.4.2  2013-06-02

- XLS file reading relies on the external Spreadsheet_Excel_Reader class which, by default,  
reads additional information about cells like fonts, styles, etc. Now that is disabled  
to save some memory since the style data is unnecessary anyway.
