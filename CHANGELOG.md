### v.0.5.12  2016-03-18

- Added a fix for recognising dates in XLS files created by LibreOffice

### v.0.5.11  2015-04-30

- Added a special case for cells formatted as text in XLSX. Previously leading zeros would get truncated if a text cell contained only numbers.

### v.0.5.10  2015-04-18

- Implemented SeekableIterator. Thanks to [paales](https://github.com/paales) for suggestion ([Issue #54](https://github.com/nuovo/spreadsheet-reader/issues/54) and [Pull request #55](https://github.com/nuovo/spreadsheet-reader/pull/55)).
- Fixed a bug in CSV and ODS reading where reading position 0 multiple times in a row would result in internal pointer being advanced and reading the next line. (E.g. reading row #0 three times would result in rows #0, #1, and #2.). This could have happened on multiple calls to `current()` while in #0 position, or calls to `seek(0)` and `current()`.

### v.0.5.9  2015-04-18

- [Pull request #85](https://github.com/nuovo/spreadsheet-reader/pull/85): Fixed an index check. (Thanks to [pa-m](https://github.com/pa-m)).

### v.0.5.8  2015-01-31

- [Issue #50](https://github.com/nuovo/spreadsheet-reader/issues/50): Fixed an XLSX rewind issue. (Thanks to [osuwariboy](https://github.com/osuwariboy))
- [Issue #52](https://github.com/nuovo/spreadsheet-reader/issues/52), [#53](https://github.com/nuovo/spreadsheet-reader/issues/53): Apache POI compatibility for XLSX. (Thanks to [dimapashkov](https://github.com/dimapashkov))
- [Issue #61](https://github.com/nuovo/spreadsheet-reader/issues/61): Autoload fix in the main class. (Thanks to [i-bash](https://github.com/i-bash))
- [Issue #60](https://github.com/nuovo/spreadsheet-reader/issues/60), [#69](https://github.com/nuovo/spreadsheet-reader/issues/69), [#72](https://github.com/nuovo/spreadsheet-reader/issues/72): Fixed an issue where XLSX ChangeSheet may not work. (Thanks to [jtresponse](https://github.com/jtresponse), [osuwariboy](https://github.com/osuwariboy))
- [Issue #70](https://github.com/nuovo/spreadsheet-reader/issues/70): Added a check for constructor parameter correctness.


### v.0.5.7  2013-10-29

- Attempt to replicate Excel's "General" format in XLSX files that is applied to otherwise unformatted cells.
Currently only decimal number values are converted to PHP's floats.

### v.0.5.6  2013-09-04

- Fix for formulas being returned along with values in XLSX files. (Thanks to [marktag](https://github.com/marktag))

### v.0.5.5  2013-08-23

- Fix for macro sheets appearing when parsing XLS files. (Thanks to [osuwariboy](https://github.com/osuwariboy))

### v.0.5.4  2013-08-22

- Fix for a PHP warning that occurs with completely empty sheets in XLS files.
- XLSM (macro-enabled XLSX) files are recognized and read, too.
- composer.json file is added to the repository (thanks to [matej116](https://github.com/matej116))

### v.0.5.3  2013-08-12

- Fix for repeated columns in ODS files not reading correctly (thanks to [etfb](https://github.com/etfb))
- Fix for filename extension reading (Thanks to [osuwariboy](https://github.com/osuwariboy))

### v.0.5.2  2013-06-28

- A fix for the case when row count wasn't read correctly from the sheet in a XLS file.

### v.0.5.1  2013-06-27

- Fixed file type choice when using mime-types (previously there were problems with
XLSX and ODS mime-types) (Thanks to [incratec](https://github.com/incratec))

- Fixed an error in XLSX iterator where `current()` would advance the iterator forward
with each call. (Thanks to [osuwariboy](https://github.com/osuwariboy))

### v.0.5.0  2013-06-17

- Multiple sheet reading is now supported:
	- The `Sheets()` method lets you retrieve a list of all sheets present in the file.
	- `ChangeSheet($Index)` method changes the sheet in the reader to the one specified.

- Previously temporary files that were extracted, were deleted after the SpreadsheetReader
was destroyed but the empty directories remained. Now those are cleaned up as well.

### v.0.4.3  2013-06-14

- Bugfix for shared string caching in XLSX files. When the shared string count was larger
than the caching limit, instead of them being read from file, empty strings were returned.

### v.0.4.2  2013-06-02

- XLS file reading relies on the external Spreadsheet_Excel_Reader class which, by default,
reads additional information about cells like fonts, styles, etc. Now that is disabled
to save some memory since the style data is unnecessary anyway.
